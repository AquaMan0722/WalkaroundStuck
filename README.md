# WalkaroundStuck
A Godot-based Homestuck walkaround project that aims to act as a foundation for others to create their own walkarounds from.

Some code (primarily for room transitions and some aspects of its Global class) derived from Sharkalien's absolutely lovely Godot recreation of the "YOU THERE. BOY." Homestuck flash (https://github.com/Sharkalien/Godot-YOU-THERE.-BOY.-Walkaround). It's cool shit, check it out.

Initially meant as a fan game for the MSPFA comic "sburb.EXE"; it's a fun read, check it out here: https://mspfa.com/?s=49229&p=1

I'll probably post a guide eventually on how to use the scripts and assets of this repo for your own walkarounds because I am terrible at commenting my code half the time.

A Trello board is also set up that will keep track of planned content for the project: https://trello.com/b/jShMRIYT/homestuck-walkaround-project
Feature creep will be the death of me. lol. lmao, even.
